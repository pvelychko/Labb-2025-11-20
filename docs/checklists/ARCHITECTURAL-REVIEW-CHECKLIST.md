- [ ] Transaction boundaries appropriate
- [ ] Data consistency and integrity constraints enforced
- [ ] Caching strategy appropriate (application, distributed, CDN)
- [ ] CQRS applied where beneficial (read/write separation)

## Anti-Pattern Detection

Check for these violations:
- [ ] No god objects (single classes with too many responsibilities)
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] No tight coupling (components changeable independently)
- [ ] No framework coupling (business logic framework-agnostic)
- [ ] No inappropriate intimacy (modules knowing too much about internals)
- [ ] No feature envy (methods using more of another class)
- [ ] No chatty interfaces (excessive back-and-forth)
- [ ] No shotgun surgery (changes requiring many file edits)
- [ ] No primitive obsession (using primitives instead of value objects)

## Performance & Scalability

### Scalability
